## 🎯 Waarom Deze Verdeling?

### 1. **Hoge Circulating Supply (40% bij launch)**

```
Public Sale:          150M (15%)  🔓
Liquidity Pools:      100M (10%)  🔓
Founder Unlocked:     100M (10%)  🔓
Strategic (partial):   50M (5%)   🔓
────────────────────────────────
Total Circulating:    400M (40%) ✅
```

**Waarom belangrijk:**
- Binance vereist: min 30% circulating
- KuCoin vereist: min 25% circulating  
- Meer circulating = betere liquiditeit
- Betere liquiditeit = stabielere prijs

### 2. **Founder: 10% Direct + 15% Locked**

**10% Direct (100M ARC):**
- Voor operations, team, marketing
- Direct liquidity
- Transparant gecommuniceerd

**15% Locked (150M ARC):**
- 4-year vesting
- Laat commitment zien
- Majority nog steeds locked (60% van founder allocation)
