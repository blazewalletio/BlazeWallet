# 🔐 BLAZE Wallet Security Analysis

## Current Implementation vs Industry Standards

### Password-Based System (Current)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Great UX - no 12 words needed
- ✅ Quick access
- ✅ Familiar to users
- ✅ Auto-lock functionality

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Browser storage vulnerability
- ⚠️ Password can be brute-forced
- ⚠️ Keylogger risk
- ⚠️ Not industry standard for crypto

### Recovery Phrase System (Traditional)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Industry standard (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.)
- ✅ True air gap security
- ✅ Cannot be hacked remotely
- ✅ Physical security model

**Cons:**
- ❌ Poor UX - 12 words every time
- ❌ Risk of losing backup
- ❌ User friction
- ❌ Not mobile-friendly

## Recommended Hybrid Approach

### Option 1: Recovery Phrase + Session Management
```
User Flow:
1. Create wallet → Show recovery phrase
2. First login → Enter recovery phrase
3. Set session password → Encrypt for session
4. Session expires → Enter recovery phrase again
5. Optional: Biometric unlock for session
```

### Option 2: Hardware Security Module (HSM)
```
Implementation:
- Use Web Crypto API for secure key generation
- Store encrypted keys in secure enclave
- Biometric authentication required
- Recovery phrase as ultimate backup
```

### Option 3: Progressive Security
```
Levels:
1. Basic: Password unlock (current)
2. Enhanced: Password + 2FA
3. Premium: Biometric + hardware security
4. Ultimate: Recovery phrase only
```

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Keep current system** for UX
2. **Add 2FA** for enhanced security
3. **Implement biometric auth** for mobile
4. **Add security warnings** about browser risks

### Long-term Strategy:
1. **Progressive security levels**
2. **Hardware wallet integration**
3. **Multi-signature support**
4. **Advanced encryption methods**

## Risk Mitigation
