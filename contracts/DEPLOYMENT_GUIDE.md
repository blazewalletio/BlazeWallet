# üöÄ BLAZE Token V4 Enhanced - Deployment Guide

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Prepare Wallets

Create separate wallets for each allocation:

```
‚úÖ Public Sale Wallet    (150M BLAZE)
‚úÖ Liquidity Wallet      (100M BLAZE)
‚úÖ Founder Wallet        (100M unlocked + receive vesting)
‚úÖ Community Wallet      (200M BLAZE)
‚úÖ Treasury Wallet       (150M BLAZE)
‚úÖ Team Wallet           (100M BLAZE)
‚úÖ Strategic Wallet      (50M BLAZE)
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Use hardware wallets (Ledger/Trezor) for large amounts
- Use multi-sig for treasury (Gnosis Safe)
- Never share private keys
- Test on testnet first!

### 2. Fund Deployer Wallet

**Ethereum Mainnet:**
- Minimum: 0.5 ETH (~$1,500)
- Recommended: 1 ETH for safety

**Sepolia Testnet:**
- Get free testnet ETH from faucets
- sepoliafaucet.com
- faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia

### 3. Set Up Environment

```bash
cd contracts
cp .env.template .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```bash
# Deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your_deployer_private_key_here

# RPC URLs
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY

# Verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key

# Wallet Addresses
PUBLIC_SALE_WALLET=0x...
FOUNDER_WALLET=0x...
COMMUNITY_WALLET=0x...
TREASURY_WALLET=0x...
TEAM_WALLET=0x...
STRATEGIC_WALLET=0x...
LIQUIDITY_WALLET=0x...
```

## üß™ Test Deployment (Sepolia)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

### Step 2: Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Expected output:
```
Compiled 15 Solidity files successfully
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Sepolia

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### Step 4: Verify Contracts

```bash
# Verify Token
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  "PUBLIC_SALE_WALLET" "FOUNDER_WALLET" "COMMUNITY_WALLET" \
  "TREASURY_WALLET" "TEAM_WALLET" "STRATEGIC_WALLET" "LIQUIDITY_WALLET"

# Verify Vesting
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <VESTING_ADDRESS> \
  "TOKEN_ADDRESS" "FOUNDER_WALLET"
```

### Step 5: Test Functions

Test on Etherscan:
1. Go to contract on Sepolia Etherscan
2. Click "Contract" ‚Üí "Write Contract"
3. Test: `stake()`, `unstake()`, `transfer()`
4. Verify burns are working
5. Check vesting schedule

## üåê Mainnet Deployment

### STOP! Final Checklist:

- [ ] All contracts tested on Sepolia
- [ ] Security audit completed (CertiK)
- [ ] Legal opinion obtained
- [ ] All wallet addresses verified (triple check!)
- [ ] Deployer wallet funded (1 ETH+)
- [ ] Team ready for launch
- [ ] Marketing materials ready
- [ ] Social media accounts set up

### Step 1: Deploy Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
```

### Step 2: Save Contract Addresses

Write these down immediately:
```
Token Address:   0x...
Vesting Address: 0x...
```

### Step 3: Fund Vesting Contract

Transfer 150M ARC to vesting contract:

```javascript
// On Etherscan or using script:
arcToken.transfer(VESTING_ADDRESS, 150000000 * 10**18)
```

### Step 4: Verify on Etherscan

```bash
# Token
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet <TOKEN_ADDRESS> \
  "0xPublicSale" "0xFounder" "0xCommunity" \
  "0xTreasury" "0xTeam" "0xStrategic" "0xLiquidity"

# Vesting
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet <VESTING_ADDRESS> \
  "<TOKEN_ADDRESS>" "0xFounder"
```
