## 💰 Budget Breakdown

### Total: $500

```
$50  → Deploy gas (BSC = goedkoop!)
$400 → Initial liquidity (bootstrap)
$50  → Marketing (organic + free tools)
```

---

## 🎯 Launch Strategy: Bootstrap & Grow

### Phase 1: Launch on BSC (Cheap!)

**Why BSC?**
- Gas fees: $0.10-0.50 (vs $50-200 op Ethereum!)
- Same code works (ERC-20 = BEP-20)
- PancakeSwap = biggest DEX
- Easy to get started

**Deployment Cost: ~$50**

### Phase 2: Minimal Liquidity

**$400 Liquidity:**
- 50M ARC + $400 BNB
- Initial price: $0.000008 per ARC
- Market Cap: $400 (FDV: $8,000)

**Strategy:**
- Start TINY
- Let community build it up
- Organic growth
- No listing fees needed!

### Phase 3: Organic Marketing

**$50 Budget:**
- Twitter/X account (free!)
- Telegram group (free!)
- Reddit posts (free!)
- PancakeSwap listing (free!)
- Dexscreener listing (automatic!)
- PooCoin ads ($50)

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Launch ($500)

### Day 1: Preparation (FREE)

**Create Accounts:**
- [ ] Twitter/X account (@ArcToken)
- [ ] Telegram group (t.me/arctoken)
- [ ] Reddit account
- [ ] GitHub repo (public)

**Create Wallets:**
- [ ] Deployer wallet (MetaMask)
- [ ] Marketing wallet
- [ ] Treasury wallet (can be same as deployer initially)

**Get $500 in BNB:**
- [ ] Buy BNB on Binance/Coinbase
- [ ] Send to deployer wallet

---

### Day 2: Deploy on BSC ($50)

**1. Update Hardhat Config for BSC:**

```javascript
// hardhat.config.js
networks: {
  bsc: {
    url: "https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org",
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    chainId: 56,
  },
  bscTestnet: {
    url: "https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545",
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    chainId: 97,
  }
}
```

**2. Simplify Tokenomics for Bootstrap:**

Only deploy token contract (skip vesting for now):
- 100M ARC public (10%)
- 50M ARC liquidity (5%)
- 850M ARC keep for later (85%)

**3. Deploy:**

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bsc
```

**Cost: ~$5 in BNB**

**4. Verify on BscScan:**

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network bsc <TOKEN_ADDRESS> <ARGS>
```

**Cost: FREE (BSCScan auto-verifies)**

---

### Day 3: Add Liquidity ($400)

**On PancakeSwap:**

1. Go to pancakeswap.finance
2. Connect wallet
3. Click "Liquidity" → "Add Liquidity"
4. Select ARC (paste contract address)
5. Add: 50M ARC + $400 BNB
6. Confirm transaction

**Cost: $400 + ~$0.50 gas**

**DO NOT LOCK YET** (costs money we don't have)
- Lock later when you have budget
- Or when community demands it

**Result:**
- Price: ~$0.000008 per ARC
- Market Cap: $400
- FDV: $8,000
- Liquidity: $800 (both sides)

---

## 📈 Growth Strategy (No Budget)

### Month 1: Bootstrap

**Organic growth:**

- Lock liquidity ($100)
- Marketing ($200)
- Development ($200)

**Price impact: Minimal (only 1%)**

### Month 3+: Scale

**If market cap hits $100k:**
- Your 850M: Worth $85k
- Sell 50M: $5k cash
- Use for:
  - Audit ($3k budget version)
  - Better marketing
  - Exchange applications

## ⚠️ Risks with $500 Budget

### 1. No Audit
**Risk:** Smart contract bugs
**Mitigation:** 
- Code is from OpenZeppelin (tested)
- Deploy on testnet first
- Small amounts only initially

### 2. Low Liquidity
**Risk:** High slippage, price volatile
**Mitigation:**
- Transparent about this
- "Bootstrap launch"
- Add more as it grows

### 3. No Marketing Budget
**Risk:** Hard to get traction
**Mitigation:**
- Organic growth (takes time)
- Community marketing
- Be active daily

### 4. Unlocked Liquidity
**Risk:** You could "rug pull"
**Mitigation:**
- Be transparent
- Lock it when you have budget ($100)
- Build trust over time

---

## ✅ What Works with $500

### Advantages:

**1. Real Token**
- On-chain
- Verifiable
- Actually works

**2. Fair Launch**
- Everyone can buy same price
- No presale
- No team dump (you own most but transparent)

**3. Room to Grow**
- Start at $8k FDV
- Can 10x, 100x, 1000x
- Early holders get best prices

**4. You Control It**
- Can add features later
- Can do marketing later
- Can get audit later
- Bootstrap → Build → Scale

---

## 🚀 Modified Deployment Plan

### Simplified Tokenomics (Bootstrap):

```
10% (100M) → Public sale (initial buyers)
5% (50M) → Liquidity
85% (850M) → Treasury (you)
  ├─ Use for marketing
  ├─ Use for development
  ├─ Sell slowly as price grows
  └─ Add to liquidity as you can
```

**Why this works:**
- Minimal deployment cost
- $400 liquidity enough to start
- You keep majority to fund growth
- Transparent (you announce this)

---

## 📝 Simplified Deploy Script

```javascript
// deploy-bootstrap.js
async function main() {
  const ArcToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("ArcToken");
  
  // Simplified for bootstrap
  const arcToken = await ArcToken.deploy(
    deployer.address, // Everything to deployer
    deployer.address,
    deployer.address,
    deployer.address,
    deployer.address,
    deployer.address,
    deployer.address
  );
  
  // Then manually distribute:
  // 100M to public sale wallet
  // 50M to liquidity
  // 850M stays in deployer (treasury)
}
```
